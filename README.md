# K nearest neighbours analysis

This is the third assignment of the Fundamentals of artificial intelligence course at the University of Ume√•.

The point was to determine ways of finding the most important features in a dataset and ways of finding the best number of neighbours so the classifier is as efficient as possible.

The files test_features.py and test_k.py are respecfully used to determine the most important features and the best number of neighbours for a given dataset.
